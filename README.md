# Scoop bucket for Nerd Fonts

This repo contains manifests for installing [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and various other fonts using the [scoop package manager](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) for Windows.

To add this bucket:

```
scoop bucket add nerd-fonts
```

#### Note: Admin rights are required to install these fonts for Windows version before Windows 10 1809, because their installers modify the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` registry. Additionally, restarting your computer after uninstalling a font is necessary for the font to be fully removed.

## Generating font manifests

Execute `bin/generate-manifests.ps1` with Powershell 3.0+ to regenerate a subset of the manifests in this repository from the template (within the same file).

### Usage

```shell
# Generate manifests only if the desired manifest does not exist.
PS> .\bin\generate-manifests.ps1

# Force re-generate all manifests.
PS> .\bin\generate-manifests.ps1 -OverwriteExisting
```

### Note

Over time this repo has accumulated a variety of fonts, not all of which are nerd fonts. The manifest generation is specifically for nerd fonts!

## Notable changes

The regular `CascadiaCode` (not NF) font manifests were [consolidated into a single manifest](https://github.com/matthewjberger/scoop-nerd-fonts/commit/e8c7114a2890a2d7ca035c132f4bb507a191a423). This was done because the [Cascadia Code official releases](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases) prior to `2004.30` had the ttf fonts attached separately, so they had different download urls. From version `2004.30` onward, the fonts are bundled in a zip file.

## Maintainer Notes

This command will upgrade all the manifests that prevents error 429 from github's api. Run it from the `bin` dir:

```powershell
gci ..\bucket\ | Select-Object -ExpandProperty BaseName | %{ .\checkver.ps1 -u $_; Start-Sleep 1 }
```
